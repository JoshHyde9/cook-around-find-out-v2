# Cook Around and Find Out

Published recipes that I have piss-farted around with or found online and changed to my liking.

## Development

1. `pnpm i`
2. `pnpm dev`

## Contributing

Contributions are more than welcomed! Just not changes to recipes because otherwise, they are not mine!

Translations are also heavily encouraged! I am more than happy for you to translate my recipes into your native language. Follow the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/i18n/) to setup your language if it isn't there.

1. Create a personal fork.
2. Clone the fork and add this original repo as a remote called `upstream`.
3. Create a new branch with changes subject to the branch name.
4. Make your changes and push to your fork.
5. From your fork, open a PR and I will have a cheeky geez.

If you can't be assed with that, open an issue and I will try and sort it out.
