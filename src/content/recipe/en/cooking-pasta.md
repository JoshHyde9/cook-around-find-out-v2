## Ingredients

- Pasta sauce 
- Dried or fresh pasta

## Method

1. Bring large pot of heavily salted water to a very steady boil.
2. Bring sauce to a simmer.
3. Add pasta to boiling water and cook according to package directions (not really).
4. 2 minutes before the pasta is cooked, use tongs to transfer pasta to the simmering sauce.
5. Grab some extra pasta water and set to the side.
6. Continue to toss pasta in sauce until sauce is thick enough to coat pasta. 
7. Use extra pasta water if sauce is too thick. If sauce is too thin, just keep tossing.
8. To serve long pastas, portion pasta into a ladle and twirl a carving fork in the middle. Pasta will naturally want to climb the fork.
9. Transfer to centre of plate, slowly release the ladle from underneath then, slowly lift to release the fork.
10. Top with a little more sauce and garnish.

### Notes
1. Obviously fresh pasta doesn't have package directions. I am assuming that if you're cooking fresh pasta, you know what you're doing.
